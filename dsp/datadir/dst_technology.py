[1, 3, u'Dry Toilet', u'A Dry Toilet is a toilet that operates without water. The Dry Toilet may be a raised pedestal that the user can sit on, or a squat pan that the user squats over. In both cases, excreta (both urine and faeces) fall through a drop hole.\r\n\r\nA Dry Toilet here refers specifically to the device that the user sits or squats over. In other literature, a Dry Toilet may refer to a variety of technologies, or combinations of technologies (especially pits).\r\nThe Dry Toilet is usually placed over a pit; if two pits are used, the pedestal or slab should be designed in such a way that it can be lifted and moved from one pit to another.\r\n\r\nThe slab or pedestal base should be well sized to the pit so that it is both safe for the user and prevents stormwater from infiltrating the pit (which may cause it to overflow).', u'technologies/Icon_dry_toilet__.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Dry_Toilet']
[2, 3, u'Urine Diversion Dry Toilet', u'A Urine Diverting Dry Toilet (UDDT) is a toilet that operates without water and has a divider so that the user, with little effort can divert the urine away from the faeces.\r\n\r\nThe UDDT toilet is built such that urine is collected and drained from the front area of the toilet, while faeces fall through a large chute (hole) in the back. Depending on the Collection and Storage/Treatment technology that follows, drying material such as lime, ash or earth should be added into the same hole after defecating.', u'technologies/Icon_urine_diverting_dry_toilet__.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Urine_Diverting_Dry_Toilet']
[3, 3, u'Urinal', u'Although the Urinal can be used with or without water, here is just considered as only used for collecting urine. Urinals are generally for men, although Urinals for women have also been developed.\r\n\r\nUrinals for women consist of raised foot-steps and a sloped channel or catchment area for conducting the urine to a collection technology. For men, Urinals can either be wall-mounted units that are vertical, or squat slabs that the user squats over.', u'technologies/Icon_urinal__.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Urinal']
[4, 3, u'Pour flush toilet', u'A Pour Flush Toilet is like a regular Flush Toilet except that instead of the water coming from the cistern above, it is poured in by the user. When the water supply is not continuous, any cistern Flush Toilet can become a Pour Flush Toilet.\r\n\r\nJust like a traditional Flush Toilet, there is a water seal that prevents odours and flies from coming back up the pipe.', u'technologies/Icon_pour_flush_toilet__.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Pour_Flush_Toilet']
[5, 3, u'Cistern flush toilet', u'The Cistern Flush Toilet is usually porcelain and is a mass-produced, factory made User Interface. The Flush Toilet consists of a water tank that supplies the water for flushing the excreta and a bowl into which the excreta are deposited.\r\n\r\nThe attractive feature of the Flush Toilet is that it incorporates a sophisticated water seal to prevent odours from coming back up through the plumbing. Depending on the age and design of the toilet, approximately 3 to 20L of water may be used per flush.', u'technologies/Icon_cistern_flush_toilet_.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Cistern_Flush_Toilet']
[6, 3, u'Urine diverting flush toilet', u'The Urine Diverting Flush Toilet (UDFT) is similar in appearance to a Cistern Flush Toilet except for the diversion in the bowl. The toilet bowl has two sections so that the urine can be separated from the faeces.\r\n\r\nWhen the user sits on the toilet, urine is collected in a drain in the front (where there is no water) and faeces are collected in the back (where there is water). The urine is collected without water, but a small amount of water is used to rinse the urine-collection bowl after the user stands up. The urine flows into a storage tank for further use or processing, while the faeces are flushed with water to be treated. The system requires dual plumbing (i.e. plumbing for the urine and for the brownwater).', u'technologies/Icon_urine_diverting_flush_toilet__.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Urine_Diverting_Flush_Toilet']
[7, 2, u'Urine storage tanks', u'When urine cannot be used immediately or transported using a Conveyance Technology (i.e. Jerrycans) it can be stored onsite in containers or tanks. The Storage Tank must then be moved or emptied into another container for transport.', u'technologies/Icon_urine_storage_tank_container__.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Storage_tanks']
[8, 2, u'Single pit', u'The Single Pit is one of the most widely used sanitation technologies. Excreta, along with anal cleansing materials (water or solids) are deposited into a pit.', u'technologies/Icon_single_pit__.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Single_Pit']
[9, 2, u'Single ventilated improved pit', u'The Single VIP is a Ventilated, Improved Pit. It is an improvement over the Single Pit because continuous airflow through the ventilation pipe vents odours and acts as a trap for flies as they escape towards the light.\r\n\r\nDespite their simplicity, well-designed Single VIPs can be completely smell free, and be more pleasant to use than some other water-based technologies.', u'technologies/Icon_single_ventilated_improved_pit__.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Single_Ventilated_Improved_Pit']
[10, 2, u'Double ventilated improved pit', u'The Double VIP has almost the same design as the Single VIP (S3) with the added advantage of a second pit that allows the technology to be used continuously and allows for safer and easier emptying.\r\n\r\nBy using two pits, one pit can be used while the contents of the second pit rests, drains, reduces in volume, and degrades. When the second pit is almost full (the excreta is 50cm from the top of the pit), it is covered, and the contents of the first pit are removed. Due to the extended resting time (at least 1 year of filling/resting) the material within the pit should be sanitized and humus-like.', u'technologies/Icon_double_ventilated_improved_pit__.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Double_Ventilated_Improved_Pit']
[11, 2, u'Fossa Alterna', u'The Fossa Alterna is an alternating, waterless (dry) double pit technology. Compared to the Double VIP which is just designed to collect, store and partially treat excreta, the Fossa Alterna is designed to make EcoHumus. The Fossa Alterna is dug to a maximum depth of 1.5 m and requires a constant input of soil. \r\n\r\nOne of the Fossa Alterna pits should fill over a period of 12\u201324 months depending on the size of the pit and the number of users. The full pit degrades during the period of time that the second pit is filling, which, ideally, should take one year. The material in the full pit will degrade into a dry, earth-like mixture that can be easily removed manually. \r\n\r\nSoil, ash, and/or leaves should be added to the pit after defecation (not urination). The soil and leaves introduce a variety of organisms like worms, fungi and bacteria which help in the degradation process.', u'technologies/Icon_fossa_alterna__.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Fossa_Alterna']
[12, 1, u'Jerrycan / tank', u'Jerrycans are light, plastic containers that can be easily carried by one person and are readily available.\r\nWhen sealed, they can be used to store or transport urine easily and without spills. In case separated urine cannot be used near the point of production, it can be transported in a Jerrycan\r\nor tank to a central collection/storage facility or to agricultural land for application.\r\n\r\nOn average, a person generates 1.5L of urine a day although this quantity may very significantly\r\ndepending on the climate and fluid consumption. A family of 5 can be expected to fill a 20L Jerrycan with urine in approximately two days. The urine can then be either stored on\r\nsite or transported immediately.', u'technologies/Icon_jerrycan_tank__.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Jerrycan_-_tank']
[13, 1, u'Human powered emptying and transport', u'Human-powered Emptying and Transport refers the different ways in which people can manually empty and/or transport sludge and septage. Human-powered Emptying and Transport of pits and tanks can mean one of three things:\r\n\r\n1) using buckets and shovels;\r\n2) using a hand-pump specially designed for sludge (e.g. the Pooh Pump or the Gulper); and\r\n3) using a portable, manually operated pump (e.g. MAPET: MAnual Pit Emptying Tech.).', u'technologies/Icon_human_powered_emptying_and_transport__.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Human-Powered_Emptying_and_Transport']
[14, 1, u'Motorized emptying and transport', u'Motorized Emptying and Transport refers to a vacuum truck or another vehicle equipped with a motorized pump and a storage tank for emptying and transporting faecal sludge, septage and urine. Humans are required to operate the pump and manoeuvre the hose, but they do not lift or transport the sludge.', u'technologies/Icon_motorized_emptying_and_transport__.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Motorized_Emptying_and_Transport']
[15, 1, u'Simplified Sewers', u'Simplified Sewers describe a sewerage network that is constructed using smaller diameter pipes laid at a shallower depth and at a flatter gradient than conventional sewers. The Simplified Sewer allows for a more flexible design associated with lower costs and a higher number of connected households. Expensive manholes are replaced with simple inspection chambers. Each discharge point is connected to an interceptor tank to prevent settleable solids and trash from entering the sewer. As well, each household should have a grease trap before the sewer connection.', u'technologies/Icon_simplified_sewers__.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Simplified_Sewers']
[16, 1, u'Solids-free sewers', u'A Solids-Free Sewer is a network of small diameter pipes that transports solids-free or pre-treated wastewater (such as septic tank or settling tank effluent) to a treatment facility for further treatment or to a discharge point. Solids-Free Sewers are also referred to as settled, small-bore, small-diameter, variable-grade gravity, or septic tank effluent gravity sewers.', u'technologies/Icon_solids_free_sewer__.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Solids-free_Sewer']
[17, 4, u'Anaerobic baffled reactor', u'An Anaerobic Baffled Reactor (ABR) is an improved septic tank because of the series of baffles over which the incoming wastewater is forced to flow. The increased contact time with the active biomass (sludge) results in improved treatment.', u'technologies/Icon_anaerobic_baffled_reactor.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Anaerobic_Baffled_Reactor']
[18, 4, u'Anaerobic filter', u'An Anaerobic Filter is a fixed-bed biological reactor. As wastewater flows through the filter, particles are trapped and organic matter is degraded by the biomass that is attached to the filter material.\r\nThis technology consists of a sedimentation tank or septic tank (refer to Technology Information\r\nSheet S9: Septic Tank) followed by one to three filter chambers. Filter material commonly\r\nused includes gravel, crushed rocks, cinder, or specially formed plastic pieces.\r\n\r\nBy providing a large surface area for the bacterial mass, there is increased contact between the organic matter and the active biomass that effectively degrades it.', u'technologies/Icon_anaerobic_filter_.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Anaerobic_Filter']
[19, 4, u'Trickling filter', u'A Trickling Filter is a fixed bed, biological filter that operates under (mostly) aerobic conditions. Pre-settled wastewater is \u2018trickled\u2019 or sprayed over the filter. As the water migrates through the pores of the filter, organics are degraded by the biomass covering the filter material.\r\n\r\nThe Trickling Filter is filled with a high specific surfaceareamaterial such as rocks, gravel, shredded PVC bottles, or special pre-formed filtermaterial. Amaterial with a specific surface area between 30 and 900m2/m3 is desirable. Pre-treatment is essential to prevent clogging and to ensure efficient treatment. The pre-treated wastewater is \u2018trickled\u2019 over the surface of the filter.', u'technologies/Icon_trickling_filter__.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Trickling_Filter']
[20, 4, u'Upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor', u'The Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket Reactor (UASB) is a single tank process. Wastewater enters the reactor from the bottom, and flows upward. A suspended sludge blanket filters and treats the wastewater as the wastewater flows through it. The microorganisms in the sludge layer degrade organic compounds.\r\n\r\nAs a result, gases (methane and carbon dioxide) are released. The rising bubbles mix the sludge without the assistance of any mechanical parts.', u'technologies/Icon_upflow_anaerobic_sludge_blanket_reactor__.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Upflow_Anaerobic_Sludge_Blanket_Reactor']
[21, 6, u'Waste stabilization ponds', u'Waste Stabilization Ponds (WSPs) are large, manmade water bodies. The ponds are filled with wastewater that is then treated by naturally occurring processes. The ponds can be used individually, or linked in a series for improved treatment. There are three types of ponds, (1) anaerobic, (2) facultative and (3) aerobic (maturation), each with different treatment and design characteristics. For the most effective treatment, WSPs should be linked in a series of three of more with effluent being transferred from the anaerobic pond to the facultative pond and finally the aerobic pond.', u'technologies/Icon_waste_stabilization_ponds__.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Waste_Stabilization_Pond']
[22, 6, u'Aerated pond', u'An Aerated Pond is a large, outdoor, mixed aerobic reactor. Mechanical aerators provide oxygen and keep the aerobic organisms suspended and mixed with the water to achieve a high rate of organic degradation and nutrient removal.', u'technologies/Icon_aerated_pond_.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Aerated_Pond']
[23, 5, u'Fill and cover / Arborloo', u'Separately collected, stored urine is a concentrated source of nutrients that can be applied as a liquid fertilizer in agriculture to replace all or some commercial chemical fertilizer. ', u'technologies/Icon_fill_and_cover_arborloo__.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Fill_and_Cover_-_Arborloo']
[24, 5, u'Application of urine', u'Separately collected, stored urine is a concentrated source of nutrients that can be applied as a liquid fertilizer in agriculture to replace all or some commercial chemical fertilizer.', u'technologies/Icon_application_of_urine_.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Application_of_Urine']
[25, 5, u'Application of dehydrated faeces', u'When faeces are stored in the absence of moisture (i.e. urine) they dehydrate into a crumbly, white-beige coarse, flaky material or powder. Dehydration means that the moisture naturally present in the faeces evaporates and/or is absorbed by the addition of adrying material (e.g. ash, sawdust, lime).', u'technologies/Icon_application_of_dehydrated_faeces_.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Application_of_Dehydrated_Faeces']
[26, 5, u'Application of compost/ecohumus', u'Composting is the term used to describe the controlled aerobic degradation of organics into a soil-like substance called compost. \u2018EcoHumus\u2019 is a term taken from Peter Morgan (see references) and is a more appropriate word to use for the material removedfrom a Fossa Alterna because it is produced passively underground and has a slightly differ-ent composition.', u'technologies/Icon_application_of_compost_eco_humus_.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Application_of_Compost_-_Eco-Humus']
[27, 5, u'Irrigation', u'To reduce dependence on freshwater and maintain a constant source of irriga-tion water throughout the year, waste waters of varying qualities can be used in agriculture. Generally, only waters that have had secondary treatment (i.e. physical and biological treat-ment) should be used to limit the risk of crop contamination and the health risk to workers. There are two kinds of irrigation technologies that are appropriate for using treated wastewa-ters: 1) Drip irrigation where the water is dripped slowly on or near the root area; and 2) Surface water irrigation where water is routed overland in a series of dug channels or fur-rows.', u'technologies/Icon_irrigation__.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Irrigation']
[28, 5, u'Soak pit', u'A Soak Pit, also known as a soakaway or leach pit, is a covered, porous-walled chamber that allows water to slowly soak into the ground. Pre-settled effluent from a Collection and Storage/Treatment or (Semi-) Centralized Treatment technology is dis-charged to the underground chamber from where it infiltrates into the surrounding soil.The Soak Pit can be left empty and lined with a porous material (to provide support and prevent collapse), or left unlined and filled with coarse rocks and gravel. The rocks and gravel will prevent the walls from collapsing, but will still provide adequate space for the wastewater.', u'technologies/Icon_soak_pit__.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Soak_Pit']
[29, 5, u'Leach field', u' A Leach Field, or drainage field, is a network perforated pipes that are laid in underground gravel-filled trenches to dissipate the effluent froma water-based Collection and Storage/Treatment or (Semi-) Centralized Treatment technology.', u'technologies/Icon_leach_field___.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Leach_Field']
[30, 5, u'Aquaculture ponds', u'Aquaculture refers to the controlled cultivation of aquatic plants and animals; this technology sheet refers exclusively to the raising of fish while the following page on Floating Macrophytes (D9) addresses the cultivation of plants. Fish can be grown in pondswhere they feed on algae and other organisms that grow in the nutrient-rich water. Through feeding, the nutrients from the wastewater are removed and the fish are eventually harvested for consumption.', u'technologies/Icon_aquaculture_ponds.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Aquaculture_Ponds']
