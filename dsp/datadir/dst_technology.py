[1, 3, u'Dry Toilet', u'A Dry Toilet is a toilet that operates without water. The Dry Toilet may be a raised pedestal that the user can sit on, or a squat pan that the user squats over. In both cases, excreta (both urine and faeces) fall through a drop hole.\r\n\r\nA Dry Toilet here refers specifically to the device that the user sits or squats over. In other literature, a Dry Toilet may refer to a variety of technologies, or combinations of technologies (especially pits).\r\nThe Dry Toilet is usually placed over a pit; if two pits are used, the pedestal or slab should be designed in such a way that it can be lifted and moved from one pit to another.\r\n\r\nThe slab or pedestal base should be well sized to the pit so that it is both safe for the user and prevents stormwater from infiltrating the pit (which may cause it to overflow).', u'technologies/Icon_dry_toilet.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Dry_Toilet']
[2, 3, u'Urine Diversion Dry Toilet', u'A Urine Diverting Dry Toilet (UDDT) is a toilet that operates without water and has a divider so that the user, with little effort can divert the urine away from the faeces.\r\n\r\nThe UDDT toilet is built such that urine is collected and drained from the front area of the toilet, while faeces fall through a large chute (hole) in the back. Depending on the Collection and Storage/Treatment technology that follows, drying material such as lime, ash or earth should be added into the same hole after defecating.', u'technologies/Icon_urine_diverting_dry_toilet.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Urine_Diverting_Dry_Toilet']
[3, 3, u'Urinal', u'Although the Urinal can be used with or without water, here is just considered as only used for collecting urine. Urinals are generally for men, although Urinals for women have also been developed.\r\n\r\nUrinals for women consist of raised foot-steps and a sloped channel or catchment area for conducting the urine to a collection technology. For men, Urinals can either be wall-mounted units that are vertical, or squat slabs that the user squats over.', u'technologies/Icon_urinal.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Urinal']
[4, 3, u'Pour flush toilet', u'A Pour Flush Toilet is like a regular Flush Toilet except that instead of the water coming from the cistern above, it is poured in by the user. When the water supply is not continuous, any cistern Flush Toilet can become a Pour Flush Toilet.\r\n\r\nJust like a traditional Flush Toilet, there is a water seal that prevents odours and flies from coming back up the pipe.', u'technologies/Icon_pour_flush_toilet.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Pour_Flush_Toilet']
[5, 3, u'Cistern flush toilet', u'The Cistern Flush Toilet is usually porcelain and is a mass-produced, factory made User Interface. The Flush Toilet consists of a water tank that supplies the water for flushing the excreta and a bowl into which the excreta are deposited.\r\n\r\nThe attractive feature of the Flush Toilet is that it incorporates a sophisticated water seal to prevent odours from coming back up through the plumbing. Depending on the age and design of the toilet, approximately 3 to 20L of water may be used per flush.', u'technologies/Icon_cistern_flush_toilet.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Cistern_Flush_Toilet']
[6, 3, u'Urine diverting flush toilet', u'The Urine Diverting Flush Toilet (UDFT) is similar in appearance to a Cistern Flush Toilet except for the diversion in the bowl. The toilet bowl has two sections so that the urine can be separated from the faeces.\r\n\r\nWhen the user sits on the toilet, urine is collected in a drain in the front (where there is no water) and faeces are collected in the back (where there is water). The urine is collected without water, but a small amount of water is used to rinse the urine-collection bowl after the user stands up. The urine flows into a storage tank for further use or processing, while the faeces are flushed with water to be treated. The system requires dual plumbing (i.e. plumbing for the urine and for the brownwater).', u'technologies/Icon_urine_diverting_flush_toilet.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Urine_Diverting_Flush_Toilet']
[7, 2, u'Urine storage tanks', u'When urine cannot be used immediately or transported using a Conveyance Technology (i.e. Jerrycans) it can be stored onsite in containers or tanks. The Storage Tank must then be moved or emptied into another container for transport.', u'technologies/Icon_urine_storage_tank_container.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Storage_tanks']

[9, 2, u'Single ventilated improved pit', u'The Single VIP is a Ventilated, Improved Pit. It is an improvement over the Single Pit because continuous airflow through the ventilation pipe vents odours and acts as a trap for flies as they escape towards the light.\r\n\r\nDespite their simplicity, well-designed Single VIPs can be completely smell free, and be more pleasant to use than some other water-based technologies.', u'technologies/Icon_single_ventilated_improved_pit.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Single_Ventilated_Improved_Pit']
[10, 2, u'Double ventilated improved pit', u'The Double VIP has almost the same design as the Single VIP (S3) with the added advantage of a second pit that allows the technology to be used continuously and allows for safer and easier emptying.\r\n\r\nBy using two pits, one pit can be used while the contents of the second pit rests, drains, reduces in volume, and degrades. When the second pit is almost full (the excreta is 50cm from the top of the pit), it is covered, and the contents of the first pit are removed. Due to the extended resting time (at least 1 year of filling/resting) the material within the pit should be sanitized and humus-like.', u'technologies/Icon_double_ventilated_improved_pit.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Double_Ventilated_Improved_Pit']
[11, 2, u'Fossa Alterna', u'The Fossa Alterna is an alternating, waterless (dry) double pit technology. Compared to the Double VIP which is just designed to collect, store and partially treat excreta, the Fossa Alterna is designed to make EcoHumus. The Fossa Alterna is dug to a maximum depth of 1.5 m and requires a constant input of soil. \r\n\r\nOne of the Fossa Alterna pits should fill over a period of 12\u201324 months depending on the size of the pit and the number of users. The full pit degrades during the period of time that the second pit is filling, which, ideally, should take one year. The material in the full pit will degrade into a dry, earth-like mixture that can be easily removed manually. \r\n\r\nSoil, ash, and/or leaves should be added to the pit after defecation (not urination). The soil and leaves introduce a variety of organisms like worms, fungi and bacteria which help in the degradation process.', u'technologies/Icon_fossa_alterna.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Fossa_Alterna']
[12, 1, u'Jerrycan / tank', u'Jerrycans are light, plastic containers that can be easily carried by one person and are readily available.\r\nWhen sealed, they can be used to store or transport urine easily and without spills. In case separated urine cannot be used near the point of production, it can be transported in a Jerrycan\r\nor tank to a central collection/storage facility or to agricultural land for application.\r\n\r\nOn average, a person generates 1.5L of urine a day although this quantity may very significantly\r\ndepending on the climate and fluid consumption. A family of 5 can be expected to fill a 20L Jerrycan with urine in approximately two days. The urine can then be either stored on\r\nsite or transported immediately.', u'technologies/Icon_jerrycan_tank.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Jerrycan_-_tank']
[13, 1, u'Human powered emptying and transport', u'Human-powered Emptying and Transport refers the different ways in which people can manually empty and/or transport sludge and septage. Human-powered Emptying and Transport of pits and tanks can mean one of three things:\r\n\r\n1) using buckets and shovels;\r\n2) using a hand-pump specially designed for sludge (e.g. the Pooh Pump or the Gulper); and\r\n3) using a portable, manually operated pump (e.g. MAPET: MAnual Pit Emptying Tech.).', u'technologies/Icon_human_powered_emptying_and_transport.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Human-Powered_Emptying_and_Transport']
[14, 1, u'Motorized emptying and transport', u'Motorized Emptying and Transport refers to a vacuum truck or another vehicle equipped with a motorized pump and a storage tank for emptying and transporting faecal sludge, septage and urine. Humans are required to operate the pump and manoeuvre the hose, but they do not lift or transport the sludge.', u'technologies/Icon_motorized_emptying_and_transport.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Motorized_Emptying_and_Transport']
[15, 1, u'Simplified Sewers', u'Simplified Sewers describe a sewerage network that is constructed using smaller diameter pipes laid at a shallower depth and at a flatter gradient than conventional sewers. The Simplified Sewer allows for a more flexible design associated with lower costs and a higher number of connected households. Expensive manholes are replaced with simple inspection chambers. Each discharge point is connected to an interceptor tank to prevent settleable solids and trash from entering the sewer. As well, each household should have a grease trap before the sewer connection.', u'technologies/Icon_simplified_sewers.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Simplified_Sewers']
[16, 1, u'Solids-free sewers', u'A Solids-Free Sewer is a network of small diameter pipes that transports solids-free or pre-treated wastewater (such as septic tank or settling tank effluent) to a treatment facility for further treatment or to a discharge point. Solids-Free Sewers are also referred to as settled, small-bore, small-diameter, variable-grade gravity, or septic tank effluent gravity sewers.', u'technologies/Icon_solids_free_sewer.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Solids-free_Sewer']
[17, 4, u'Anaerobic baffled reactor', u'An Anaerobic Baffled Reactor (ABR) is an improved septic tank because of the series of baffles over which the incoming wastewater is forced to flow. The increased contact time with the active biomass (sludge) results in improved treatment.', u'technologies/Icon_anaerobic_baffled_reactor.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Anaerobic_Baffled_Reactor']
[18, 4, u'Anaerobic filter', u'An Anaerobic Filter is a fixed-bed biological reactor. As wastewater flows through the filter, particles are trapped and organic matter is degraded by the biomass that is attached to the filter material.\r\nThis technology consists of a sedimentation tank or septic tank (refer to Technology Information\r\nSheet S9: Septic Tank) followed by one to three filter chambers. Filter material commonly\r\nused includes gravel, crushed rocks, cinder, or specially formed plastic pieces.\r\n\r\nBy providing a large surface area for the bacterial mass, there is increased contact between the organic matter and the active biomass that effectively degrades it.', u'technologies/Icon_anaerobic_filter.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Anaerobic_Filter']
[19, 4, u'Trickling filter', u'A Trickling Filter is a fixed bed, biological filter that operates under (mostly) aerobic conditions. Pre-settled wastewater is \u2018trickled\u2019 or sprayed over the filter. As the water migrates through the pores of the filter, organics are degraded by the biomass covering the filter material.\r\n\r\nThe Trickling Filter is filled with a high specific surfaceareamaterial such as rocks, gravel, shredded PVC bottles, or special pre-formed filtermaterial. Amaterial with a specific surface area between 30 and 900m2/m3 is desirable. Pre-treatment is essential to prevent clogging and to ensure efficient treatment. The pre-treated wastewater is \u2018trickled\u2019 over the surface of the filter.', u'technologies/Icon_trickling_filter.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Trickling_Filter']
[20, 4, u'Upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor', u'The Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket Reactor (UASB) is a single tank process. Wastewater enters the reactor from the bottom, and flows upward. A suspended sludge blanket filters and treats the wastewater as the wastewater flows through it. The microorganisms in the sludge layer degrade organic compounds.\r\n\r\nAs a result, gases (methane and carbon dioxide) are released. The rising bubbles mix the sludge without the assistance of any mechanical parts.', u'technologies/Icon_upflow_anaerobic_sludge_blanket_reactor.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Upflow_Anaerobic_Sludge_Blanket_Reactor']
[21, 6, u'Waste stabilization ponds', u'Waste Stabilization Ponds (WSPs) are large, manmade water bodies. The ponds are filled with wastewater that is then treated by naturally occurring processes. The ponds can be used individually, or linked in a series for improved treatment. There are three types of ponds, (1) anaerobic, (2) facultative and (3) aerobic (maturation), each with different treatment and design characteristics. For the most effective treatment, WSPs should be linked in a series of three of more with effluent being transferred from the anaerobic pond to the facultative pond and finally the aerobic pond.', u'technologies/Icon_waste_stabilization_ponds.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Waste_Stabilization_Pond']
[22, 6, u'Aerated pond', u'An Aerated Pond is a large, outdoor, mixed aerobic reactor. Mechanical aerators provide oxygen and keep the aerobic organisms suspended and mixed with the water to achieve a high rate of organic degradation and nutrient removal.', u'technologies/Icon_aerated_pond.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Aerated_Pond']

[25, 5, u'Application of dehydrated faeces', u'When faeces are stored in the absence of moisture (i.e. urine) they dehydrate into a crumbly, white-beige coarse, flaky material or powder. Dehydration means that the moisture naturally present in the faeces evaporates and/or is absorbed by the addition of adrying material (e.g. ash, sawdust, lime).', u'technologies/Icon_application_of_dehydrated_faeces.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Application_of_Dehydrated_Faeces']
[26, 5, u'Application of compost / ecohumus', u'Composting is the term used to describe the controlled aerobic degradation of organics into a soil-like substance called compost. \u2018EcoHumus\u2019 is a term taken from Peter Morgan (see references) and is a more appropriate word to use for the material removedfrom a Fossa Alterna because it is produced passively underground and has a slightly differ-ent composition.', u'technologies/Icon_application_of_compost_eco_humus.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Application_of_Compost_-_Eco-Humus']
[27, 5, u'Irrigation', u'To reduce dependence on freshwater and maintain a constant source of irriga-tion water throughout the year, waste waters of varying qualities can be used in agriculture. Generally, only waters that have had secondary treatment (i.e. physical and biological treat-ment) should be used to limit the risk of crop contamination and the health risk to workers. There are two kinds of irrigation technologies that are appropriate for using treated wastewa-ters: 1) Drip irrigation where the water is dripped slowly on or near the root area; and 2) Surface water irrigation where water is routed overland in a series of dug channels or fur-rows.', u'technologies/Icon_irrigation.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Irrigation']
[28, 5, u'Soak pit', u'A Soak Pit, also known as a soakaway or leach pit, is a covered, porous-walled chamber that allows water to slowly soak into the ground. Pre-settled effluent from a Collection and Storage/Treatment or (Semi-) Centralized Treatment technology is dis-charged to the underground chamber from where it infiltrates into the surrounding soil.The Soak Pit can be left empty and lined with a porous material (to provide support and prevent collapse), or left unlined and filled with coarse rocks and gravel. The rocks and gravel will prevent the walls from collapsing, but will still provide adequate space for the wastewater.', u'technologies/Icon_soak_pit.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Soak_Pit']
[29, 5, u'Leach field', u' A Leach Field, or drainage field, is a network perforated pipes that are laid in underground gravel-filled trenches to dissipate the effluent froma water-based Collection and Storage/Treatment or (Semi-) Centralized Treatment technology.', u'technologies/Icon_leach_field.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Leach_Field']
[30, 5, u'Aquaculture ponds', u'Aquaculture refers to the controlled cultivation of aquatic plants and animals; this technology sheet refers exclusively to the raising of fish while the following page on Floating Macrophytes (D9) addresses the cultivation of plants. Fish can be grown in pondswhere they feed on algae and other organisms that grow in the nutrient-rich water. Through feeding, the nutrients from the wastewater are removed and the fish are eventually harvested for consumption.', u'technologies/Icon_aquaculture_ponds.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Aquaculture_Ponds']
[31, 5, u'Floating plant (macrophyte) pond', u'A floating plant pond is a modified maturation pond with floating (macrophyte) plants. Plants such as water hyacinths or duckweed float on the surface while the roots hang down into the water to uptake nutrients and filter the water that flows by.', u'technologies/Icon_floating_plant_macrophyte_pond.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Floating_Plant_%28Macrophyte%29_Pond']
[32, 5, u'Water disposal / groundwater recharge', u'Treated effluent and/or stormwater can be discharged directly into receiving water bodies (such as rivers, lakes, etc.) or into the ground to recharge aquifers.It is necessary to ensure that the assimilation capacity of the receiving water body is not ex-ceeded, i.e. that the receiving body can accept the quantity of nutrients without being over-loaded. Parameters such as turbidity, temperature, suspended solids, BOD, nitrogen andphosphorus (among others) should be carefully controlled and monitored before releasing any water into a natural body. The use of the water body, whether it is used for industry, rec-reation, spawning habitat, etc., will influence the quality and quantity of treated wastewaterthat can be introduced without deleterious effects.', u'technologies/Icon_water_disposal_groundwater_recharge.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Water_Disposal_-_Groundwater_Recharge']
[33, 5, u'Land application of sludge', u'Digested or stabilized Faecal Sludge is refered to as \u2018Biosolids\u2019. Depending on the quality of the biosolids, they can be applied to public or private lands, for landscaping or for agriculture.', u'technologies/Icon_land_application_of_sludge.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Land_Application_of_Sludge']
[34, 5, u'Surface disposal', u'Surface Disposal refers to the stockpiling of sludge, faeces, biosolids, or other materials that cannot be used elsewhere. Once thematerial has been taken to a Surface Disposal site, it is not used later. This technology is primarily used for biosolids, although it isapplicable for any type of dry, unusable material.', u'technologies/Icon_surface_disposal.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Surface_Disposal']
[35, 4, u'Free water surface constructed wetland', u'A Free-Water Surface ConstructedWetland is a series of flooded channels that aims to replicate the naturally occurring processes of a natural wetland,marsh or swamp. As water slowly flows through the wetland, particles settle, pathogens are destroyed, and organisms and plants utilize the nutrients.', u'technologies/Icon_free-water_surface_constructed_wetland.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Free-Water_Surface_Constructed_Wetland']
[36, 4, u'Vertical flow constructed wetland', u'A Vertical Flow Constructed Wetland is a filter bed that is planted with aquatic plants. Wastewater is poured or dosed onto the wetland surface from above using a mechanical dosing system. The water flows vertically down through the filter matrix. The important difference between a vertical and horizontal wetland is not simply the direction of the flow path, but rather the aerobic conditions.', u'technologies/Icon_vertical_flow_constructed_wetland.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Vertical_Flow_Constructed_Wetland']
[37, 4, u'Anaerobic biogas reactor', u'An Anaerobic Biogas Reactor is an anaerobic treatment technology that produces (a) a digested slurry to be used as a soil amendment and (b) biogas which can be used for energy. Biogas is a mix of methane, carbon dioxide and other trace gases that can be easily converted to electricity, light and heat.', u'technologies/Icon_anaerobic_biogas_reactor.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Anaerobic_Biogas_Reactor']
[38, 2, u'Twin pits for pour flush', u'This technology consists of two alternating pits connected to a Pour Flush Toilet. The blackwater (and greywater) is collected in the pits and allowed to slowly infiltrate into the surrounding soil. With time, the solids are sufficiently dewatered and can be manually removed with a shovel. The superstructure, toilet and pits, for the Twin Pits with Pour Flush technology can be designed in various ways: the toilet can be located directly over the pits or at a distance from the pits. The superstructure can be permanently constructed over both pits or it can move from side to side depending on which pit is in use. No matter how the system is designed, only one pit is used at a time. In this way, a continuous cycle of alternating pits means that they can be used indefinitely.', u'technologies/Icon_twin_pits_for_pour_flush.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Twin_Pits_for_Pour_Flush']
[39, 2, u'Dehydration vaults', u'Dehydration vaults are used to collect, store and dry (dehydrate) faeces. Faeces will only dehydrate when the vaults are watertight to prevent external moisture from entering and when urine and anal cleansing water are diverted away from the vaults. When urine is separated from faeces, the faeces dry quickly. In the absence of moisture, organisms cannot grow and as such, smells are minimized and pathogens are destroyed.\r\n\r\nEach vault is sized to accommodate six months of faeces accumulation which in turn, results in a six month drying time in the out-of-service vault. Two alternating vaults allow the faeces to dehydrate in one vault while the other vault fills. When one vault is full it is sealed with a lid and the Urine Diversion Dry Toilet is moved to the second vault. While the second vault fills up, the faeces in the first vault slowly dry and decrease in volume.', u'technologies/Icon_dehydration_vaults_2.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Dehydration_Vaults']
[40, 2, u'Composting chamber', u'Composting refers to the process bywhich biodegradable components are biologically decomposed under aerobic conditions by microorganisms (mainly bacteria and fungi). A Composting Chamber converts excreta and organics into Compost. Compost is a stable, inoffensive product that can be handled safely and used as a soil conditioner.\r\n\r\nThis technology usually requires four main parts:\r\n\r\n1) a reactor (storage chamber);\r\n2) a ventilation unit to provide oxygen and allow gases (CO2, water vapour) to escape;\r\n3) a leachate collection system ; and\r\n4) an access door to remove the mature product.', u'technologies/Icon_composting_chamber.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Composting_Chamber']
[41, 6, u'Free-water surface constructed wetland', u'A Free-Water Surface ConstructedWetland is a series of flooded channels that aims to replicate the naturally occurring processes of a natural wetland,marsh or swamp. As water slowly flows through the wetland, particles settle, pathogens are destroyed, and organisms and plants utilize the nutrients.\r\n\r\nUnlike The Horizontal Subsurface Flow Constructed Wetland (T6), the Free-Water Surface Constructed Wetland allows water to flow above ground, exposed to the atmosphere and direct sunlight. The channel or basin is lined with an impermeable barrier (clay or geotextile) covered with rocks, gravel and soil and planted with native vegetation (e.g. cattails, reeds and/or rushes).\r\n\r\nThe wetland is flooded with wastewater to a depth of 10 to 45cm above ground level. As the water slowly flows through the wetland, simultaneous physical, chemical and biological processes filter solids, degrade organics and remove nutrients from the wastewater.', u'technologies/Icon_free-water_surface_constructed_wetland.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Free-Water_Surface_Constructed_Wetland']
[42, 6, u'Horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland', u'A Horizontal Subsurface FlowConstructedWetland is a large gravel and sand-filled channel that is planted with aquatic vegetation. As wastewater flows horizontally through the channel, the filtermaterial filters out particles and microorganisms degrade organics.\r\n\r\nThe water level in a Horizontal Subsurface Flow Constructed Wetland is maintained at 5 to 15cm below the surface to ensure subsurface flow. The bed should be wide and shallow so that the flow path of the water is maximized. A wide inlet zone should be used to evenly distribute the flow. Pre-treatment is essential to prevent clogging and ensure efficient treatment.', u'technologies/Icon_horizontal_subsurface_flow_constructed_wetland.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Horizontal_Subsurface_Flow_Constructed_Wetland']
[43, 6, u'Vertical flow constructed wetland', u'A Vertical Flow Constructed Wetland is a filter bed that is planted with aquatic plants. Wastewater is poured or dosed onto the wetland surface from above using a mechanical dosing system. The water flows vertically down through the filter matrix. The important difference between a vertical and horizontal wetland is not simply the direction of the flow path, but rather the aerobic conditions.\r\n\r\nBy dosing the wetland intermittently (four to ten times a day), the filter goes through stages of being saturated and unsaturated, and accordingly, different phases of aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The frequency of dosing should be timed such that the previous dose of wastewater has time to percolate through the filter bed so that oxygen has time to diffuse through the media and fill the void spaces.\r\n\r\nThe Vertical Flow Constructed Wetland can be designed as a shallow excavation or as an above ground construction. Each filter should have an impermeable liner and an effluent collection system. Vertical Flow Constructed Wetlands are most commonly designed to treat wastewater that has undergone primary treatment.', u'technologies/Icon_vertical_flow_constructed_wetland.png', u'http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Vertical_Flow_Constructed_Wetland']
[44, 2, u'Septic Tank', u'A Septic Tank is a watertight chamber made of concrete, fibreglass, PVC or plastic, for the storage and treatment of blackwater and greywater. Settling and anaerobic processes reduce solids and organics, but the treatment is only moderate.\r\n\r\nA Septic Tank should typically have at least two chambers. The first chamber should be at least 50% of the total length and when there are only two chambers, it should be 2/3 of the total length. Most of the solids settle out in the first chamber. The baffle, or the separation between the chambers, is to prevent scum and solids from escaping with the effluent. A T-shaped outlet pipe will further reduce the scum and solids that are discharged.\r\n\r\nLiquid flows into the tank and heavy particles sink to the bottom, while scum (oil and fat) floats to the top. With time, the solids that settle to the bottom are degraded anaerobically. However, the rate of accumulation is faster than the rate of decomposition, and the accumulated sludge must be removed at some point. Generally, Septic Tanks should be emptied every 2 to 5 years, although they should be checked yearly to ensure proper functioning.\r\n\r\nThe design of a Septic Tank depends on the number of users, the amount of water used per capita, the average annual temperature, the pumping frequency and the characteristics of the wastewater. The retention time should be designed for 48 hours to achieve moderate treatment. ', u'technologies/Icon_septic_tank_2.png', u'']
[45, 1, u'Conventional Gravity Sewer', u'Conventional Gravity Sewers are large networks of underground pipes that convey blackwater, greywater and stormwater from individual households to a centralized treatment facility using gravity (and pumps where necessary).\r\n\r\nThe Conventional Gravity Sewer system is designed with many branches. Typically, the network is subdivided into primary (main sewer lines along main roads), secondary, and tertiary networks (network at the neighbourhood and household level).\r\n\r\nConventional Gravity Sewers do not require onsite pretreatment or storage of the wastewater. Because the waste is not treated before it is discharged, the sewer must be designed to maintain self-cleansing velocity (i.e. a flow that will not allow particles to accumulate). A self-cleansing velocity is generally 0.6\u20130.75m/s. A constant downhill gradient must be guaranteed along the length of the sewer to maintain self-cleaning flows. When a downhill grade cannot be maintained, a pump station must be installed. Primary sewers are laid beneath roads, and must be laid at depths of 1.5 to 3m to avoid damages caused by traffic loads.\r\n\r\nAccess manholes are placed at set intervals along the sewer, at pipe intersections and at changes in pipeline direction (vertically and horizontally). The primary network requires rigorous engineering design to ensure that a self-cleansing velocity is maintained, that manholes are placed as required and that the sewer line can support the traffic weight. As well, extensive construction is required to remove and replace the road above. ', u'technologies/Icon_conventional_gravity_sewer.png', u'']
[46, 1, u'Sewer Discharge Station', u'A Sewer Discharge Station (SDS) is a point along the sewermain that can be legally accessed and used for discharging septage and sludge directly into the sewer so that it can be transported to a (Semi-) Centralized Treatment facility. SDSs are intermediate transfer points for sludge that cannot easily be transported to a dedicated treatment facility. Sludge can be dumped in a local SDS rather than either a) dumping it illegally or b) trying to travel to a distant collection point.\r\n\r\nSludge is dumped into the SDS and then either released directly to the sewer or held in a temporary storage tank before being released to the sewer at a set time. Timed release can help prevent solids from building up in the sewer line and also help optimize the treatment efficiency of the treatment technology by reducing peak loading.\r\n\r\nA SDS consists of a parking place or discharge dock for the vacuum truck or sludge cart and a connection point for the discharge hose. The SDS may also have a storage tank and pumping system. The dumping point should be built low enough to minimize spills when labourers are manually emptying their sludge carts. Additionally, SDS should include a vent, a trash screen to remove large debris (garbage) and a washing facility for vehicles. The station should be well protected and maintained to prevent random dumping into the sewer and to ensure the safety of the users.\r\n\r\nA variation is a stand-alone Transfer Station that is not connected to a sewer main (for more information, refer to: Transfer Station (Underground Holding Tank). When the Transfer Station is full, a vacuum truck must empty the stored contents and take the sludge to a suitable treatment facility. If the municipality or sewerage authority is operating the Transfer Station they may charge for permits to dump in the Transfer Station to offset the cost of maintaining the facility.

[47, 1, u'Transfer Station (Underground Holding Tank)', u'Sometimes termed Underground Holding Tanks, Transfer Stations act as intermediate dumping points for faecal sludge when it cannot be easily transported to a (Semi-) Centralized Treatment facility. A vacuum truck must empty Transfer Stations when they are full.\r\n\r\nManual, or small scale sludge emptiers who use the MAPET or the Gulper, for example, dump the sludge in a local transfer station rather than either a) dumping it illegally or b) trying to travel to a distant collection point.\r\n\r\nWhen the Transfer Station is full, a vacuum truck empties the contents and takes the sludge to a suitable treatment facility.

[48, 4, u'Unplanted Drying Beds', u'An Unplanted Drying Bed is a simple, permeable bed that, when loaded with sludge, collects percolated leachate and allows the sludge to dry by evaporation. Approximately 50% to 80% of the sludge volume drains off as liquid. The sludge however, is not stabilized or treated.\r\n\r\nThe bottom of the drying bed is lined with perforated pipes that drain away the leachate. On top of the pipes are layers of sand and gravel that support the sludge and allow the liquid to infiltrate and collect in the pipe. The sludge should be loaded to approximately 200kg TS/m2 and it should not be applied in layers that are too thick (maximum 20cm), or the sludge will not dry effectively. The final moisture content after 10 to 15 days of drying should be approximately 60%. A splash plate should be used to prevent erosion of the sand layer and to allow the even distribution of the sludge. When the sludge is dried, it must be separated from the sand layer and disposed of. The effluent that is collected in the drainage pipes must also be treated properly. The top sand layer should be 25 to 30cm thick as some sand will be lost each time the sludge is manually removed.

[49, 4, u'Planted Drying Beds', u'A Planted Drying Bed is similar to an Unplanted Drying Bed with the benefit of increased transpiration. The key feature is that the filters do not need to be desludged after each feeding/drying cycle. Fresh sludge can be applied directly onto the previous layer; it is the plants and their root systems that maintain the porosity of the filter.\r\n\r\nThis technology has the benefit of dewatering as well as stabilizing the sludge. Also, the roots of the plants create pathways through the thickening sludge to allow water to escape more easily.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the bed is similar to a Vertical Flow Constructed Wetland. The beds are filled with sand and gravel to support the vegetation. Instead of effluent, sludge is applied to the surface and the filtrate flows down through the subsurface to collect in drains. A general design for layering the bed is: (1) 250mm of coarse gravel (grain diameter of 20mm); (2) 250mm of fine gravel (grain diameter of 5 mm); and (3) 100\u2013150mm of sand. Free space (1m) should be left above the top of the sand layer to account for about 3 to 5 years of accumulation.\r\n\r\nWhen the bed is constructed, the plants should be planted evenly and allowed to establish themselves before the sludge is applied. Echinochloa pyramidalis, Cattails or Phragmites are suitable plants depending on the climate.\r\n\r\nSludge should be applied in layers between 75 to 100mm and should be reapplied every 3 to 7 days depending on the sludge characteristics, the environment and operating constraints. Sludge application rates of up to 250kg/m2/year have been reported. The sludge can be removed after 2 to 3 years (although the degree of hygienization will vary with climate) and used for agriculture.

[50, 4, u'Activated Sludge', u'Activated Sludge is a multi-chamber reactor unit that makes use of (mostly) aerobic microorganisms to degrade organics in wastewater and to produce a high-quality effluent. To maintain aerobic conditions and to the keep the active biomass suspended, a constant and well-timed supply of oxygen is required.\r\n\r\nDifferent configurations of the Activated Sludge process can be employed to ensure that the wastewater is mixed and aerated (with either air or pure oxygen) in an aeration tank. The microorganisms oxidize the organic carbon in the wastewater to produce new cells, carbon dioxide and water. Although aerobic bacteria are the most common organisms, aerobic, anaerobic, and/or nitrifying bacteria along with higher organisms can be present. The exact composition depends on the reactor design, environment, and wastewater characteristics. During aeration and mixing, the bacteria form small clusters, or flocs. When the aeration stops, the mixture is transferred to a secondary clarifier where the flocs are allowed to settle out and the effluent moves on for further treatment or discharge. The sludge is then recycled back to the aeration tank, where the process is repeated.\r\n\r\nTo achieve specific effluent goals for BOD, nitrogen and phosphorus, different adaptations and modifications have been made to the basic Activated Sludge design. Aerobic conditions, nutrient-specific organisms (especially for phosphorus), recycle design and carbon dosing, among others, have successfully allowed Activated Sludge processes to achieve high treatment efficiencies.

[51, 4, u'Sedimentation - Thickening Ponds', u'Sedimentation or Thickening Ponds are simple settling ponds that allow the sludge to thicken and dewater. The effluent is removed and treated, while the thickened sludge can be treated in a subsequent technology.\r\n\r\nFaecal sludge is not a uniform product and therefore, its treatment must be specific to the characteristics of the specific sludge. In general, there are two types of faecal sludges: high strength (originating from latrines and unsewered public toilets) and low strength (originating from Septic Tanks. High strength sludge is still rich in organics and has not undergone significant degradation, which makes it difficult to dewater. Low strength sludge has undergone significant anaerobic degradation and is more easily dewatered.
